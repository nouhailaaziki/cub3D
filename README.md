cub3D is a 3D graphical project from the 42 curriculum. The goal is to create a basic 3D game engine using raycasting, inspired by early games like Wolfenstein 3D. It uses the MiniLibX graphics library to render a 3D view from a 2D map, allowing the player to move around and interact with the environment.

## MLX42 library

MLX42 is a **graphics library** made by 42 Network students as a modern replacement for the original **MiniLibX (mlx)** that was provided by 42 school.

Here’s the breakdown:

### What it is

- **MLX42** is a lightweight C library built on **OpenGL** and **GLFW**.

- It provides a simple API to create a window, handle keyboard/mouse input, and draw images/pixels.

- It’s designed to be cross-platform (Linux, macOS, sometimes Windows with tweaks), unlike the old MiniLibX which had a lot of platform limitations.

### Why it exists

- The original MiniLibX was outdated, buggy, and heavily tied to X11 (Linux) or Quartz (macOS).

- Many students had problems compiling it, especially on modern macOS.

- MLX42 is meant to be easier to install, more reliable, and more flexible.

### What you can do with MLX42

Create a window and render graphics.

Handle events (keyboard, mouse, window resize, close).

Draw pixels, lines, textures, and images.

Use OpenGL under the hood, but without needing to learn OpenGL directly.
