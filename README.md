# cub3D
cub3D is a 3D graphical project from the 42 curriculum. The goal is to create a basic 3D game engine using raycasting, inspired by early games like Wolfenstein 3D. It uses the MiniLibX graphics library to render a 3D view from a 2D map, allowing the player to move around and interact with the environment.
